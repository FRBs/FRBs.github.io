# Motivation

This site is intended to be the home of FRB community software. Here you will find links to public code repositories used for FRB science, guides for using these, and information on how you can contribute with your own software. Repos listed under the [FRBs Organisation](https://github.com/FRBs) on GitHub have been quality assessed for usability and, importantly, have been provided free by the FRB community, for everyone.

# Software repos
User guides for these software packages can be found by clicking on the books (ðŸ““) beside their names. The markdown files behind these guides can be found [here](https://github.com/FRBs/FRBs.github.io/tree/master/user-guides), and contributions can be made through pull requests.
